# Students-Database
This application can add/edit/remove students profiles as well searching records by Student's name
In the beginning you need to pick an option using number (1-6). 
Once feature finishes it's work you will be asked if you want to get back to main menu, it requires you to input capital "Y" if you wish so.
While adding/editing students' name you only can input a single word. (You can't use space basically)
If you wish to exit from application using option #6, it will ask you if you want to get to main menu, type whatever you want but "Y".
